  ACTIVATEEVENTS - Toggle event activation for Timeseries axes.
  ActivateEvents
 
  Toggles event activation for all current "Timseries" axes. 
  This includes initialization of ROI bounding lines on the 
  time axis and assignment of the button-press "callback_axes" 
  action to the axes regions.

  ADDMISSINGLAYERS - Coordinate name layers among two or more datasets.
  [Data1,Data2,Data3,...] = AddMissingLayers(Data1,Data2,Data3,...)
 
  Adds missing name layers as required to coordinate the 
  name layers among two or more provided datasets 'Data1', 
  'Data2', 'Data3', etc.  The resulting datasets are returned 
  in the same order, and contain all name layers present in 
  the input datasets.

  ADDNAMELAYER - Add a new name layer to a dataset or signal group.
  Data = AddNameLayer(Data,layer)
  Data = AddNameLayer(Data,{'layer1','layer2',...})
  Data = AddNameLayer(...,'null')
  DATA = AddNameLayer(DATA, ...)
  Signals = AddNameLayer(Signals, ...)
  SIGNALS = AddNameLayer(SIGNALS, ...)
 
  Accepts a dataset 'Data', dataset array 'DATA', signal group 'Signals', 
  or signal group array 'SIGNALS', and adds a new name layer to all signal 
  groups, to correspond with the existing name layers.  The name layer is 
  populated based on information on the "MASTER" tab of "NameTables.xlsx". 
  Each new name is drawn from the first row within the NameTables that 
  yields a match to the names in the existing name layers. 
 
  The new name layer is specified by input string 'layer', which refers 
  to the column in the MASTER table from which the new names are drawn. 
  If "NameTables.xlsx" does not exist, or if 'layer' is not a registered 
  MASTER tab column, a new name layer with all blank names is added.  
  This behavior can also be forced by specifying the 'null' option as 
  a final argument. 
 
  Also accepts a cell array of layer names.  Any entries in the array 
  that are already part of the dataset are ignored.

  ADDSIGNALTOGROUP - Add a signal to a new or existing signal group.
  Signals = AddSignalToGroup(Signals,name,x,units,description,layer)
  Signals = AddSignalToGroup(name,x,units,description,layer)
 
  Adds signal 'x' to the input 'Signals' group.  Inputs 'name', 
  'units', and 'description' are strings specifying the signal 
  name, units, and description, and 'layer' specifies the 
  name layer on which the name is to be recorded. (An empty 
  string name is placed on the remaining name layers.) 
 
  It is permissible for 'name', 'units', or 'description' to 
  be specified as empty strings.  If 'x' is an empty vector, 
  an all-NaN signal is added.  If 'x' is scalar, it is extended 
  to the appropriate length. 
 
  If 'Signals' is empty or omitted, the function builds a new 
  one-signal group from the provided signal information.

<TD vAlign=top><pre><u id="name05">ApplyFunction</u></pre></TD>
<TD><PRE>
  APPLYFUNCTION - Apply a function to data in datasets or signal groups.
  Data = ApplyFunction(Data,fun,{'group1','group2',...})
  Data = ApplyFunction(Data,fun,{'signal1','signal2',...})
  Data = ApplyFunction(Data,fun,Selections)
  Data = ApplyFunction(Data,fun,'all')
  Data = ApplyFunction(Data,fun)
  DATA = ApplyFunction(DATA, ...)
  Signals = ApplyFunction(Signals, ...)
  SIGNALS = ApplyFunction(SIGNALS, ...)
 
  Applies a user-specified function 'fun' to a dataset, signal 
  group, dataset array, or signal group array.  For datasets, the 
  'Selections' input is a cell array specifying a list of signal 
  and/or group names to which the function should be applied. If 
  'Selections' is omitted (or if the character string 'all' is 
  specified in its place), the function is applied to all groups 
  in the dataset, including 'Time'. 
 
  Functions are applied "in place", replacing the signal or 
  group data to which they are applied.  Functions applied to 
  signals should accept a single column vector argument and 
  produce a column vector output. Functions applied to groups 
  should accept a matrix input and return a matrix with the same 
  number of columns. 
 
  Caution should be taken to ensure that applying the function 
  does not result in a violation of the dataset structure. For 
  example, if a function is applied to signals, it should preserve 
  the signal length.  If a function applies to only a selection of 
  groups, it should preserve the signal length for the dataset as 
  a whole.  However, functions applied to the entire dataset may  
  alter the signal length, provided that the effect on length is

  BUILDDATASET - Build a signal evaluation dataset based on NameTables.
  Data = BuildDataset(casename,pathnames,groups,layers,source)
  Data = BuildDataset(casename,pathnames,groups,layers)
 
  Builds a "signal evaluation dataset" based on definition information 
  recorded in "NameTables.xlsx".  The result is a structure containing 
  one or more "signal groups" as fields, where each signal group is 
  itself a structure with fields:
     '&lt;Layer1&gt;Names'  -  cell array of "Layer 1" signal names, 
     '&lt;Layer2&gt;Names'  -  cell array of "Layer 2" signal names, 
        ...           -  cell array of ...       signal names,
     '&lt;LayerN&gt;Names'  -  cell array of "Layer N" signal names, 
     'Values'         -  matrix with columns containing signal sequences, 
     'Units'          -  cell array of unit designations ('m', 'kN', etc.), 
     'Descriptions'   -  cell array of signal descriptions. 
  where the number of signal channels defines the length of the 
  cell arrays and the number of columns in the 'Values' field. 
 
  The signal groups included in the output structure are specified 
  by input cell array 'groups', and the signals contained in these 
  groups are defined on the "MASTER" tab of "NameTables.xlsx".  
 
  Each signal group includes one or more "name layers", specified 
  by input cell array 'layers'.  These refer to column headers also 
  appearing on the "MASTER" tab spreadsheet.  The signal names from 
  these columns are used to populate the various 'Names' fields, so 
  that each signal can be associated with one or more names. However, 
  the data used to populate the 'Values' field comes from a single 
  source, that source being either specified directly, via the 
  'source' argument, or defined by the "primary" name layer, which 
  is taken to be the first layer specified in 'layers' if 'source' 
  is not specified. 
 
  The file(s) from which the data are drawn are given by input 
  'pathnames', which can be either a single string pathname or 
  a cell array of pathnames.  In the latter case, data from 
  successive files are concatenated.  Any file formats supported 
  by "ExtractData" are permissible, and file formats need not be 
  the same for all pathnames. 
 
  Data read from the specified pathnames are subject to units 
  conversions and description changes prescribed in "NameTables.xlsx" 
  on the "sourcetype" tab that corresponds to the determined 'source' 
  ("Sourcetypes" are specified below "sources" on row 2 of the MASTER 
  tab.) However, NO CONVERSION is applied to .vtl files, as these are 
  assumed to be converted in advance, and no conversion is applied 
  if the 'sourcetype' is ''. 
 
  Though not listed in "NameTables.xlsx", a signal group 'Time' is 
  always included in the output structure, with fields paralleling 
  those of the other signal groups.  Time is returned in either 
  real-valued or absolute date-time units, depending on the input 
  file type. 
 
  Input 'casename' is a user-specified identification string, which 
  is returned as the first field of the output structure, along with 
  a 'pathnames' field to record the data file(s) read.  A final field 
  'source' is also included.  The source string is derived by removing 
  the final "Names" characters from the primary, or source, name layer.

  Data = BuildDatasetFromData(Table)
  Data = BuildDatasetFromData(s1)
  Data = BuildDatasetFromData(S)
  Data = BuildDatasetFromData(...,source)
 
  Builds a dataset from raw signal data. The signal and attribute data 
  are supplied in one of several ways: 
 
    - Time vector 't' and column-oriented 'Values' array, where length 
      of time vector matches number of rows in 'Values'.  Time 't' is 
      assumed in 'sec' units if not given in absolute units ('datetime' 
      or 'datenum'), and if 't' is omitted, a unitless 'Index' is assumed, 
      starting at value 1.  The M columns of the 'Values' array are 
      assigned generic signal names 'x1', 'x2', ..., 'xM', and all 
      signal units and descriptions are set to the empty string (''). 
 
    - Table or timetable 'Table'. Time is determined by the 'RowTimes' 
      property or by a 'Time' column, if present. If not, a unitless 
      'Index' is assumed, starting at value 1. Columns with non-numeric 
      data are ignored. Multi-dimensional data are handled by expansion 
      into an equivalent set of one-dimensional signals per the note 
      below (*).
 
    - Scalar structure 's1' with column-oriented fields having equal 
      number of rows.  Time is determined by a 'Time' field, if present. 
      If not, unitless 'Index' is assumed, starting at 1. Field names 
      are taken as variable names, but all units and descriptions are 
      set to the empty string (''). Fields with non-numeric data are 
      ignored.  Matrix-valued and multi-dimensional fields are handled 
      by expansion into an equivalent set of one-dimensional signals 
      as described below (*). 
 
    - S-array 'S', wherein all signal names and attributes are taken 
      directly from fields of structure array 'S'.  For a description 
      of the S-array data structure, see function "MakeSarray" or type 
      "help formats". 
 
  (*) In the case of 2- or higher dimensional array data, the array is 
  expanded into an equivalent set of 1-dimensional column vectors to 
  produce a new set of 1-dimensional signals.  The corresponding variable 
  name is interpreted as a root name, and appropriate subscripting with 
  trailing numerals is used to name the individual signals. The underscore 
  character '_' is employed where necessary to separate the subscripts.  
  Units and descriptions are replicated across the expanded set of signals. 
 
  An optional final string argument 'source' can be provided 
  if specification of a dataset source is desired.

  Builds supplementary dataset 'Data' from a new data source, based 
  on a model dataset 'Data0'.  The source for the dataset is determined 
  by 'source', or, alternatively, 'layer', these referring to a column 
  on the "MASTER" tab of "NameTables.xlsx".  Input 'Data0' is a dataset 
  structure with signal-group fields.  This sample dataset establishes 
  the signal groups and the order of signals within groups for the new 
  dataset 'Data'.  The file(s)  from which to extract new data replacing 
  the existing data is specified by string or cell array 'pathnames'.

  TIMES = BuildTimeArray(SIGNALS,name,Time,offset,units,description)
 
  Builds time signal group array 'TIMES' corresponding in size 
  to signal group array 'SIGNALS'.  Input string 'name' specifies 
  the time signal name, scalar 'Ts' the sample time, string 'units' 
  the time units, and 'description' the description string to 
  apply to all elements in the array.  For example, the command 
  "TIMES = BuildTimeArray(SIGNALS,'Time',0.5,0,'sec','Time vector')" 
  results in time signals named 'Time' with 0.5-sec sampling and 
  description string 'Time vector' assigned for all elements of 
  'SIGNALS'.  All name layers in 'SIGNALS' are represented in the 
  result. 
 
  The 'offset' parameter permits "sequencing" of the time groups, 
  by specifies the spacing* between the start times of successive 
  elements.  If keyword 'join' is specified in place of 'offset', 
  the start time of the kth element is set to the end time of the 
  (k-1)th element.  If 'catenate' is specified, successive elements 
  are spaced with one sample time of separation**. 
 
  As an alternative to specifying a scalar sample time value, a 
  2-vector [t0,Ts] defining start time 't0' and sample time 'Ts', 
  or an appropriately sized time vector ('t' signifying elapsed 
  time or 'Time' designating absolute time), may be specified in 
  place of 'Ts'.  If a full time vector is supplied, data lengths 
  must be compatible and uniform across the 'SIGNALS' array. 
 
  (*) Offset may be specified as a 'duration' value when 
      time values are of 'datetime' type.  Seconds are 
      assumed if a real value is supplied. 
  (**) Sample time is determined from "GetSampleTime" using 
      the 'simple' method option.

  A warning normally results if one or more signal names specified in 
  "NameTables.xlsx" is not present in the array.  The 'nowarn' option, 
  specified as a final argument, suppresses this warning.

  Forms VTool datasets by running the dataset-building function specified 
  by function handle 'datafun' on data files found in a folder, and stacks 
  them into a dataset array. 
 
  Input 'dname' specifies the data folder, and 'filetype' specifies 
  a file type among any valid type recognized by VTool (see function 
  "IsFileType").  Alternatively, a cell array of pathnames to desired 
  input files may be directly specified via a 'pathnames' argument. The 
  dimensions of the dataset array follow from those of the 'pathnames' 
  argument. 
 
  Function 'datafun' is any function taking a data file pathname as input 
  and producing a single VTool dataset as output.  Datasets are assembled 
  into a dataset array 'DATA', with each element of the array representing

  the current working directory or the 'dname' folder.  That file may 
  list either simple filenames or full pathnames. If some files are to 
  be excluded, those filenames or pathnames should be listed in a file 
  called "exclude.txt" and the file placed in the working directory 
  or 'dname' folder. The "include.txt" file, if found, is read before

  Files used: "include.txt"
              "exclude.txt"
              "LoadResults.m"
 
  Collects datasets from VTool "results" files found in folder 'dname'.  
  Files are assumed to be named according to the convention "results_*.mat" 
  and their contents are assumed to include one or more VTool datasets. 
  Alternatively, a cell array of pathnames to desired input files is 
  directly specified via a 'pathnames' argument. 
 
  The datsets are assembled into dataset arrays, one per dataset variable, 
  with each element of the arrays corresponding to a single identified 
  (or specified) file.  The dataset arrays are named by converting the 
  original dataset variable names to all-caps (e.g., 'DataIn' becomes 
  'DATAIN').  The arrays have the same dimension as the specified or 
  derived 'pathnames' list. 
 
  As an alternative to operating on all results files found in the 
  'dname' folder, specific filenames to be included may also be listed 
  in a file "include.txt" placed either in the current working directory 
  or the 'dname' folder.  That file may list either simple filenames or 
  full pathnames. If some files are to be excluded, those filenames or 
  pathnames should be listed in a file called "exclude.txt" and the file 
  placed in the working directory or 'dname' folder. The "include.txt" 
  file, if found, is read before any "exclude.txt" file.  If these files 
  are found in both locations, the current working directory takes 
  precedence. 
 
  Any non-dataset variables found in the files are assembled into 
  arrays of the appropriate type, with length equal to the number 
  of files.  NOTE: All files must contain the same variables, or an 
  error will result. 
 
  The function "LoadResults" is used to load data from the input files. 
  The default version of this function can be found in "&lt;VTool&gt;\templates". 
  A local copy of this function can be used to provide user-definable 
  modifications to the file contents (e.g., re-sampling or other 
  size-reducing operations).  As an alternative to a local copy, a user-
  defined function handle may be directly provided via the 'LoadFun' 
  option (see below). 
 
  Additional options may be specified via option/value pairs, as follows: 
    'LoadFun'         -  function handle defining a user-selectable 
                         load function. For example, @(x)load(x,'var1') 
                         limits loading to the 'var1' variable only. 
    'CategoryFun'     -  function handle applied to file root names to 
                         derive "category strings".  If provided, the 
                         function performs a separate collection operation 
                         for each detected category. As an example, the 
                         function @(x)x(1:10) can be used to extract date 
                         strings from root names that start with the pattern 
                         'yyyy-mm-dd', to perform separate collections by 
                         date. (Root names are derived from pathnames 
                         using function "GetRootname".) 
    'DownSampFactor'  -  integer-valued downsampling factor. If specified, 
                         all datasets are downsampled by this factor. 
    'TimeRange'       -  1 x 2 vector specifying a desired [Tmin,Tmax] 
                         within the available time range. This operation 
                         is applied after any downsampling. See function 
                         "LimitTimeRange" for options. 
    'OutputTag'       -  optional tag string to be included as part of 
                         the output filename (see below). 
 
  The resulting dataset array(s), along with array(s) representing non-
  dataset variables, plus a cell array containing the included filenames, 
  are stored as file "collected_datasets.mat" within the 'dname' folder, 
  unless an optional output folder 'outfolder'is specified. If 'pathnames' 
  are specified, the 'outfolder' argument is required.  If collection is 
  by category, the output files are named "collected_datasets_*.mat", with

              "exclude.txt"
 
  Collects a defined set of signals from data files found in a folder, 
  and assembles them in a format suitable for statistical analysis.  
  Input 'dname' specifies the data folder, and 'filetype' specifies 
  a file type among any valid type recognized by VTool (see function 
  "IsFileType").  Alternatively, a cell array of pathnames to desired 
  input files may be directly specified via a 'pathnames' argument. 
 
  Loads signals into a signal group array 'SIGNALS', with each element 
  of the array containing the signals drawn from a single identified 
  (or specified) file. The dimensions of the signal group array follow 
  from the dimensions of the specified or derived 'pathnames' list. 
  
  The desired signal names are specified in file "names.txt", which 
  must be present in the 'dname' folder or the current working 
  directory, with the current working directory taking precedence. 
  Alternatively, signal names can be specified via the 'Selections' 
  option below.  All named signals are represented in all elements 
  of the signal group array, with the signal data reverting to all 
  NaNs for any signals not found in a particular file. 
 
  As an alternative to operating on all files found in the 'dname folder, 
  specific filenames to be included may be listed in a file "include.txt" 
  placed either in the current working directory or the 'dname' folder.  
  That file may list either simple filenames or full pathnames. If some 
  files are to be excluded, those filenames or pathnames should be listed 
  in a file called "exclude.txt" and the file placed in the working 
  directory or 'dname' folder. The "include.txt" file, if found, is read 
  before any "exclude.txt" file.  If these files are found in both 
  locations, the current working directory takes precedence. 
 
  Time vectors corresponding to all files read are similary assembled 
  into signal group array 'TIMES', with each TIME(i) representing the 
  time read from the ith file found.  If all time vectors are equal, 
  a single-element signal group 'Time' is generated instead. 
 
  Additional options may be specified via option/value pairs, as follows: 
    'Selections'      -  cell array of signal names to collect. Overrides  
                         retrieval of these names from "names.txt". 
    'SourceType'      -  'sourcetype' identifier from "NameTables.xlsx", 
                         specifying units conversions and description 
                         modifications to be applied to the named signals 
                         (see function "ExtractData"). 
    'CategoryFun'     -  function handle applied to file root names to 
                         derive "category strings".  If provided, the 
                         function performs a separate collection operation 
                         for each detected category. As an example, the 
                         function @(x)x(1:10) can be used to extract date 
                         strings from root names that start with the pattern 
                         'yyyy-mm-dd', to perform separate collections by 
                         date. (Root names are derived from pathnames 
                         using function "GetRootname".) 
    'DownSampFactor'  -  integer-valued downsampling factor. If specified, 
                         all signals are downsampled by this factor. 
    'TimeRange'       -  1 x 2 vector specifying a desired [Tmin,Tmax] 
                         within the available time range. This operation 
                         is applied after any downsampling. See function 
                         "LimitTimeRange" for options. 
    'OutputTag'       -  optional tag string to be included as part of 
                         the output filename (see below). 
 
  The resulting signal group array 'SIGNALS' and time array 'TIMES'  
  (or signal group 'Time'), along with a cell array 'fnames' listing 
  the names and order of files read, are stored as .mat file 
  "collected_signals.mat" within the 'dname' folder, unless an 
  optional output folder 'outfolder' is specified.  If 'pathnames' 
  are specified, the 'outfolder' argument is required.  If collection

  The named signals are assembled into signal group arrays, one per

  are reduced to a single 'TIMES' array, and if any time group array 
  contains equal array elements, that array is reduced to a single 
  time group 'Time_&lt;...&gt;', or to a global 'Time' signal group if the 
  scalar groups themselves are equal. 
 
  Any non-dataset variables found in the files are assembled into

  COMBINESTATSFILES - Combine multiple "computed_stats" files into one.

  [Stats,Info] = CombineStatsFiles(pathnames)
 
  Combines the content from two or more "computed_stats_*.mat" files

  If output arguments are provided, the results are returned as output 
  structure array 'Stats' and information structure 'Info' instead. 
 
  Input 'pathnames' is a cell array of pathnames to the files to be 
  combined.  To qualify for combining, the individual files must have 
  been produced by "ComputeStatsArray" using the same calling options.  
  In addition, although the 'edges1' and 'edges2' options used for 
  generating the original files should be the same, the data represented 
  in the different files must fall in non-overlapping classification 
  bins (although multiple bins per input file are permissible). 
 
  The order of pathnames in the provided list is important, and should 
  correspond to strictly increasing values of the classification (i.e.,

    1) The percentile statistics ('p05','p50','p95') within the

  COMPAREDATASETS - Compare two datasets.
  CompareDatasets(Data1,Data2)
  CompareDatasets(Data1,Data2 [,'full'] [,'plot'])
  [metrics,message1,message2] = CompareDatasets(...)
 
  Compares two datasets, 'Data1' and 'Data2'.  Reports differences 
  by field and signal group, or plots differences by signal.  Also 
  detects name array differences(*).  Columns with equivalent signal 
  data (i.e., "equal" or "equal with equal nans") are excluded from 
  reporting unless the 'full' option is specified.  Absolute time 
  offsets between the datasets are ignored. 
 
  Supported options are: 
     'full'   -  option to include all signals in reporting 
                 rather than limiting to signals with differences.
     'plot'    - option results in a plot of computed metrics, 
                 defined below. 
 
  The following metrics are computed and represented in either 
  screen display, returned output, or plotting.  If returned as 
  output, they are provided as subfields of structure 'metrics', 
  under field names corresponding to the signal groups to which 
  the signals belong.  Letting 'x1' and 'x2' denote a pair of 
  corresponding signals from 'Data1' and 'Data2', respectively, 
  the represented quantities are: 
     'index'      -  signal index within the signal group
     'maxabs'     -  maximum absolute difference
                       = max(abs(x2-x1))
     'maxfrac'    -  maximum fractional difference
                       = max(abs((x2-x1)./x1))
     'rmsrel'     -  rms difference, relative to max value
                       = rms(x2-x1)/max(abs(x1))
     'maxabsrel'  -  maximum absolute difference, relative to max value
                       = max(abs(x2-x1))/max(abs(x1))
     'status'     -  a status indicator set as follows:
                       -1  -&gt;  not equal
                        0  -&gt;  equal, with no NaN values
                        1  -&gt;  equal, taking NaN values as equal
  These quantities are all Nx1 vectors, where N is the number of 
  signals compared (the full set of signals, if 'full' option chosen, 
  or the number of signals with differences otherwise). In computing 
  'maxfrac', values from 'x2' are substituted for 'x1' in the denominator 
  wherever 'x1' is zero.  In computing 'rmsrel' and 'maxabsrel', 
  max(abs(x2)) is used in place of max(abs(x1)) if 'x1' is identically 
  zero.  NaN values in 'maxabs', 'maxfrac', 'rmsrel', and 'maxabsrel' 
  signify that no numerical values remain after removal of NaN entries. 
 
  Also returned as outputs are two message strings: 
     'message1'  -  summarizes the equality status for all signal data.

  COMPARESIGNALGROUPS - Compare two signal groups.
  CompareSignalGroups(Signals1,Signals2)
  CompareSignalGroups(Signals1,Signals2 [,'full'] [,'plot'])
  [metrics,message1,message2] = CompareSignalGroups(...)
 
  Compares two signal groups, 'Signals1' and 'Signals2'.  Reports 
  or plots differences in their 'Values' arrays by column(*).  Also 
  detects name array differences(**).  Columns with equivalent signal 
  data (i.e., "equal" or "equal with equal nans") are excluded from 
  reporting unless the 'full' option is specified. 
 
  Supported options are: 
     'full'   -  option to include all signals in reporting 
                 rather than limiting to signals with differences.
     'plot'    - option results in a plot of computed metrics, 
                 defined below. 
 
  The following metrics are computed and represented in either 
  screen display, returned output, or plotting.  If returned as 
  output, they are provided as fields of structure 'metrics'. 
  Letting 'x1' and 'x2' denote a pair of corresponding signals 
  from 'Signals1' and 'Signals2', respectively, the represented 
  quantities are: 
     'index'      -  signal index
     'maxabs'     -  maximum absolute difference
                       = max(abs(x2-x1))
     'maxfrac'    -  maximum fractional difference
                       = max(abs((x2-x1)./x1))
     'rmsrel'     -  rms difference, relative to max value
                       = rms(x2-x1)/max(abs(x1))
     'maxabsrel'  -  maximum absolute difference, relative to max value
                       = max(abs(x2-x1))/max(abs(x1))
     'status'     -  a status indicator set as follows:
                       -1  -&gt;  not equal
                        0  -&gt;  equal, with no NaN values
                        1  -&gt;  equal, taking NaN values as equal
  These quantities are all Nx1 vectors, where N is the number of 
  signals compared (the full set of signals, if 'full' option chosen, 
  or the number of signals with differences otherwise). In computing 
  'maxfrac', values from 'x2' are substituted for 'x1' in the denominator 
  wherever 'x1' is zero.  In computing 'rmsrel' and 'maxabsrel', 
  max(abs(x2)) is used in place of max(abs(x1)) if 'x1' is identically 
  zero.  NaN values in 'maxabs', 'maxfrac', 'rmsrel', and 'maxabsrel' 
  signify that no numerical values remain after removal of NaN entries. 
 
  Also returned as outputs are two message strings: 
     'message1'  -  summarizes the equality status for the 'Values' arrays. 
     'message2'  -  reports if name-layer or name-array differences are detected. 
  If the 'metrics' output is supplied or the 'plot' option is chosen, screen 
  output is limited to display of 'message2' only.  However, if all output 
  arguments are provided, all screen output is suppressed.

  ComputeClassVector(...)
 
  Computes the binning index vector for signal group array 'SIGNALS', 
  given selection of a signal 'name', a statistical function 'choice', 
  and specification of bin boundaries.  Input 'choice' specifies 
  either a statistical function ('mean','std','median','max','min',
  'mode') or a scalar value signifying a percentile value between 
  0 and 100. Vector 'edges' defines monotonically increasing bin 
  boundaries, where edge(i) specifies the left edge, and edge(i+1) 
  the right edge of the ith bin (with '-inf' and 'inf' values at the 
  ends permitted). 
 
  Output 'iclass' is a vector equal in length to 'SIGNALS' returning 
  the bin index value for each element of 'SIGNALS'.  A value iclass=0 
  marks cases falling outside the specified binning range.  Output 
  'BinResults' is a structure array equal in length to the number of 
  bins, containing the fields: 
    'index'   -  bin index
    'center'  -  bin center value
    'cases'   -  number of cases

  of the classification to the screen, but returns no outputs.  However, 
  the 'report' option may be specified if both outputs and reporting 
  are desired.

  Computes "Error-PSD" spectra for signals in two signal-group 
  arrays according to a binning scheme.  Inputs 'SIGNALS1' and 
  'SIGNALS2' are matching length-N arrays to be compared.  Both 
  are homogeneous signal groups of M signals each.  Input 'iclass' 
  is a length-N vector of bin index values ranging from 0 to P, 
  with 0 indicating array elements to be excluded from the analysis.  
  Input 'Ts' is the sample time, in sec. 
 
  THE "ERROR-PSD" SPECTRUM OF SIGNALS X1 AND X2 IS DEFINED AS THE 
  PSD OF THE DIFFERENCE SIGNAL X2-X1.
 
  Output 'Stats' is a structure giving the representative Error-PSD 
  spectra of the individual signal channels, segregated by bin. Output 
  'f' is the corresponding frequency vector.  Structure 'Stats' has 
  the following fields, each a length(f) x M x P numerical array:

  the form of a signal group array corresponding to 'SIGNALS1' and 
  'SIGNALS2'. 
 
  To support computation of additional statistics not listed above,

    Stats.std = cat(3,C{:});
 
  The default units for all spectra, both in 'Stats' and 'PSD', 
  are in (.)^2/Hz.  However, if 'dB' is specified as a final 
  argument, 'Stats' and 'PSD' (but not the raw data in 'Cpsd')

  [gxx,f] = ComputePSD(x,Fs)
  [gxx,f] = ComputePSD(x,Fs,'dB')
 
  Computes the power spectral density estimate of a 
  single time series 'x' given sampling frequency 'Fs'.  
  Output 'gxx' is returned in units of (.)^2/Hz. However, 
  if 'dB' is specified as as final argument, 'gxx' is 
  returned in dB. 
 
  Output 'f' is the corresponding frequency vector. 
  The frequency resolution of the result is specified 
  by a fixed VTool parameter 'df', which governs the 
  employed window length.  The window length is not 
  restricted to be a power of 2.

  [Stats,f,PSD] = ComputePsdByBin(SIGNALS,iclass,Ts,'dB')
  [Stats,f,PSD,Cpsd] = ComputePsdByBin(...)
 
  Computes statistical PSD spectra for signals in a signal-group 
  array according to a binning scheme.  Input 'SIGNALS' is a 
  length-N array of homogeneous signal groups of M signals each.  
  Input 'iclass' is a length-N vector of bin index values ranging 
  from 0 to P, with 0 indicating array elements to be excluded 
  from the analysis.  Input 'Ts' is the sample time, in sec. 
 
  Output 'Stats' is a structure giving statistically representative 
  PSD spectra of the individual signal channels, segregated by bin.  
  Output 'f' is the corresponding frequency vector.  Structure 'Stats' 
  has the following fields, each a length(f) x M x P numerical array: 
    'min'   -  point-wise minimum PSD by bin
    'max'   -  point-wise maximum PSD by bin
    'mean'  -  point-wise mean PSD by bin
    'p05'   -  point-wise 5th-percentile PSD by bin
    'p50'   -  point-wise 50th-percentile (median) PSD by bin
    'p95'   -  point-wise 95th-percentile PSD by bin
 
  Output 'PSD' gives the complete set of raw PSD spectra, in the 
  form of a signal group array corresponding to 'SIGNALS'. 
 
  To support computation of additional statistics not listed above, 
  cell array 'Cpsd' is available as an optional output.  Each cell 
  of 'Cpsd' contains a 3d array of length(f) rows and M columns, 
  with the sample PSDs distributed in the third dimension.  The 
  cells of 'Cpsd' represent the raw PSD spectra from the M signals 
  segregated by bin. Thus, for example, a standard deviation ('std') 
  field with default normalization can be added as follows: 
    C = cellfun(@(x)std(x,0,3),Cpsd,'Uniform',false);
    Stats.std = cat(3,C{:});
 
  The default units for all spectra, both in 'Stats' and 'PSD', 
  are in (.)^2/Hz.  However, if 'dB' is specified as a final 
  argument, 'Stats' and 'PSD' (but not the raw data in 'Cpsd')

  COMPUTESTSTATSBYBIN - Compute ST signal-group array statistics by bin.
  Stats = ComputeStStatsByBin(SIGNALS,iclass)
  [Stats,Cval] = ComputeStStatsByBin(...)
 
  Computes "short-time" statistics from a signal-group array 
  according to a binning scheme.  ST or "short-time" statistics 
  refer to pointwise statistics with no combining of points (e.g., 
  though 'min', 'max', or 'mean') in the time domain. 
 
  Input 'SIGNALS' is a length-N array of homogeneous signal groups 
  of M signals each.  Input 'iclass' is a length-N vector of bin 
  index values ranging from 0 to P, with 0 indicating array elements 
  to be excluded from the analysis. 
 
  Output 'Stats' is a structure giving statistics of all signal 
  channels, segregated by bin.  The structure has the following 
  fields, each a P x M matrix corresponding to the P bins and M 
  signals: 
    'min'   -  minimum values by bin
    'max'   -  maximum values by bin

  ComputeStatsArray(pathname,ArrayName0,outfolder,&lt;Option1&gt;,&lt;Value&gt;,&lt;Option2&gt;,{Value&gt;,...)
  [Stats,Info] = ComputeStatsArray(...)
 
  Computes a "Stats array" from a saved set of signal group arrays. 
  Fields of the Stats array represent "self" and "comparison" statistics 
  for the signal group arrays found in a "collected_signals_*.mat" file 
  (as produced, for example, by functions "CollectSignalsFromFiles" or 
  "CollectSignalsFromResults"). Parameter 'pathname' specifies the 
  pathname to the input file, and 'ArrayName0' specifies which array 
  within the file to regard as the reference to which all remaining 
  arrays (if present) should be compared.  The arrays in the file are 
  assumed to be of equal length, with all name layers and signal lengths 
  equal. 
 
  Results are assembled in structure array 'Stats', with Stats(i).name 
  identifying a signal group array being compared to the reference array, 
  and the remaining fields representing the computed statistics. If 
  output arguments are not provided, the 'Stats' structure array is 
  saved in a mat-file either to the current working directory or to an 
  optionally specified 'outfolder', with filename derived by replacing 
  the string 'collected_signals' by 'computed_stats'. 
 
  The function behavior can be modified by supplying option/value 
  pairs after the 'outfolder' argument, or after a [] provided in 
  its place.  The following options are available: 
    'ArrayNames'   -  specifies a subset of signal group arrays 
                      and their order of comparison to 'ArrayName0'. 
                      If not specified, all valid arrays in the file 
                      are compared. 
    'Selections'   -  cell array of signal names to include in the 
                      statistics calculations.  The default is all 
                      signals in the arrays. 
    'nameF'        -  signal name to use for filtering cases from 
                      the arrays.  If not provided, no filtering 
                      is performed. 
    'rangesF'      -  nx2 matrix of "valid ranges" for the 'nameF' 
                      signal, each row defining a [min,max] interval. 
                      A case is considered valid if the 'nameF' signal 
                      remains within valid intervals for the full 
                      duration of the case.  If invalid, the case is 
                      removed from all arrays and excluded from the 
                      statistics calculations. Default is [-inf,inf]. 
    'valuesF'      -  vector of "valid values" for the 'nameF' signal. 
                      Similar to 'rangesF', but applicable if the 
                      'nameF' signal is discrete. A case is considered 
                      valid if the 'nameF' signal takes on only values 
                      specified in this vector for the full duration. 
    'nameC'        -  classification signal name to use for "binned 
                      statistics". If not provided, no classification 
                      is performed. 
    'edges1'       -  specifies the classification bin boundaries 
                      used for time-domain statistics computations, 
                      The default is 10 bins of equal width between 
                      the minimum and maximum value of the 'nameC 
                      signal. 
    'spectral'     -  'on' or 'off', specifying whether to compute 
                      frequency-domain statistics.  Default is 'off'. 
                      Requires uniform time sampling, with sample 
                      time determined by one or more Time signal 
                      groups found in the file. 
    'edges2'       -  specifies the classification bin boundaries 
                      used for frequency-domain statistics, 
                      The default is the same as for 'edges1'. 
    'includeData'  -  'on' or 'off', specifying whether to include 
                      raw and derived signal group array data on 
                      the 'Stats' structure (as Stats(i).SIGNALS, 
                      Stats(i).PSD, etc.) and in the saved file. 
                      Default is 'off'. 
 
  As a supplement to 'Stats', a scalar 'Info' structure is also 
  stored in the output file, or returned.  This structure captures 
  additional information resulting from the statistical processing, 
  including the assumed values of the above options, and information 
  useful for interpreting and plotting results.

  ConcatDataFromFiles(pathnames,datafun,outfolder)
  ConcatDataFromFiles(..., &lt;Option1&gt;,&lt;Value&gt;,&lt;Option2&gt;,{Value&gt;,...)
 
  Files used: "include.txt"
              "exclude.txt"
 
  Generates a concatenated dataset from a "dataset function" and a set 
  of data files in a folder.  Forms VTool datasets by running the dataset-
  building function specified by function handle 'datafun' on each file, 
  then concatenates these into a single dataset and stores the result.  
  Function 'datafun' is any function taking a data file pathname as input 
  and producing a single VTool dataset as output. 
 
  Input 'dname' specifies the data folder, and 'filetype' specifies 
  a file type among any valid type recognized by VTool (see function 
  "IsFileType").  Alternatively, a cell array of pathnames to desired 
  input files may be directly specified via a 'pathnames' argument. 
 
  As an alternative to operating on all files found, specific filenames 
  to be included may be listed in a file "include.txt" placed either in 
  the current working directory or the 'dname' folder.  That file may 
  list either simple filenames or full pathnames. If some files are to 
  be excluded, those filenames or pathnames should be listed in a file 
  called "exclude.txt" and the file placed in the working directory 
  or 'dname' folder. The "include.txt" file, if found, is read before 
  any "exclude.txt" file.  If these files are found in both locations, 
  the current working directory takes precedence. 
 
  Additional options may be specified via option/value pairs, as follows: 
    'CategoryFun'     -  function handle applied to file root names to 
                         derive "category strings".  If provided, the 
                         function performs a separate concatenation operation 
                         for each detected category. As an example, the 
                         function @(x)x(1:10) can be used to extract date 
                         strings from root names that start with the pattern 
                         'yyyy-mm-dd', to perform separate collections by 
                         date. (Root names are derived from pathnames 
                         using function "GetRootname".) 
    'DownSampFactor'  -  integer-valued downsampling factor. If specified, 
                         all datasets are downsampled by this factor. 
    'NanSeparators'   -  'on' or 'off' (default). If 'on', NaN values 
                         are placed at the dataset endpoints before 
                         concatenation, to permit individual datasets 
                         to be distinguished when plotting. 
    'OutputTag'       -  optional tag string to be included as part of 
                         the output filename (see below). 
 
  The resulting dataset and a cell array 'fnames' containing the 
  included filenames are stored as file "joined_dataset.mat" within 
  the 'dname' folder, unless an optional output folder 'outfolder' is 
  specified.  If 'pathnames' are specified, the 'outfolder' argument 
  is required.  If concatenation is by category, the output files are 
  named "joined_dataset_*.mat", with the derived category strings 
  appended.  The 'OutputTag' string, if provided, is enclosed in 
  parentheses and appended at the end of the final filename root.

  Files used: "include.txt"

              "LoadResults.m"
 
  Concatenates datasets from VTool "results" files found in folder 
  'dname'.  Files are assumed to be named according to the convention 
  "results_*.mat" and their contents are assumed to include one or more 
  VTool datasets.  Alternatively, a cell array of pathnames to desired 
  input files is directly specified via a 'pathnames' argument. 
 
  The datsets are concatenated into extended-length datasets, one per 
  dataset variable found in the results files.  The new datasets retain 
  their original names. 
 
  As an alternative to operating on all results files found in the 
  'dname' folder, specific filenames to be included may also be listed 
  in a file "include.txt" placed either in the current working directory 
  or the 'dname' folder.  That file may list either simple filenames or 
  full pathnames. If some files are to be excluded, those filenames or 
  pathnames should be listed in a file called "exclude.txt" and the file 
  placed in the working directory or 'dname' folder. The "include.txt" 
  file, if found, is read before any "exclude.txt" file.  If these files 
  are found in both locations, the current working directory takes 
  precedence. 
 
  Any non-dataset variables found in the files are assembled into 
  arrays of the appropriate type, with length equal to the number 
  of files.  NOTE: All files must contain the same variables, or an 
  error will result. 
 
  The function "LoadResults" is used to load data from the input files. 
  The default version of this function can be found in "&lt;VTool&gt;\templates". 
  A local copy of this function can be used to provide user-definable 
  modifications to the file contents (e.g., re-sampling or other 
  size-reducing operations).  As an alternative to a local copy, a user-
  defined function handle may be directly provided via the 'LoadFun' 
  option (see below). 
 
  Additional options may be specified via option/value pairs, as follows: 
    'LoadFun'         -  function handle defining a user-selectable 
                         load function. For example, @(x)load(x,'var1') 
                         limits loading to the 'var1' variable only. 
    'CategoryFun'     -  function handle applied to file root names to 
                         derive "category strings".  If provided, the 
                         function performs a separate concatenation operation 
                         for each detected category. As an example, the 
                         function @(x)x(1:10) can be used to extract date 
                         strings from root names that start with the pattern 
                         'yyyy-mm-dd', to perform separate concatenations by

  CONCATDATASETS - Concatenate datasets into a single dataset.
  DataOut = ConcatDatasets(Data1,Data2,Data3, ...)
  DataOut = ConcatDatasets(DATA1,DATA2,DATA3, ...)
  DataOut = ConcatDatasets(DATA)
 
  Accepts one or more datasets (Data1,Data2,Data3,...) or 
  dataset array inputs ('DATAi') and produces a single dataset 
  with the signals in all groups concatenated.  All inputs must 
  have the same fields.  If the "attribute"  fields of all datasets 
  (i.e., the non-signal-group fields) are equal, these attributes 
  are transfered directly to the output dataset.  If not, a new set 
  of attributes is derived by combining the attributes of the original 
  dataset inputs. 
 
  Note: no adjustment beyond concatenation is performed on the 
  'Time' group.  See function "SequenceDatasets" and function 
  "ConvertToElapsedTime" for options on modifying 'Time' groups 
  before or after concatenation.

  CONCATSIGNALSFROMFILES - Concatenate signals from data files in a folder.
  ConcatSignalsFromFiles(dname,filetype [,outfolder])
  ConcatSignalsFromFiles(pathnames,outfolder)
  ConcatSignalsFromFiles(..., &lt;Option1&gt;,&lt;Value&gt;,&lt;Option2&gt;,{Value&gt;,...)
 
  Files used: "names.txt"
              "include.txt"
              "exclude.txt"
 
  Collects a defined set of signals from data files found in a folder, 
  and concatenates them into a full-length signal group with associated 
  'Time' group.  Input 'dname' specifies the data folder, and 'filetype' 
  specifies a file type among any valid type recognized by VTool (see 
  function "IsFileType").  Alternatively, a cell array of pathnames to 
  desired input files may be directly specified via a 'pathnames' argument. 
 
  The named signals are extracted from each file, and concatenated into 
  a single signal group, extending the data length until the files are 
  exhausted.  The same procedure is followed with the time vector from 
  each file.  The signal group is generically named 'Signals' and the 
  time group 'Time'. 
  
  The desired signal names are specified in file "names.txt", which 
  must be present in the 'dname' folder or the current working 
  directory, with the current working directory taking precedence. 
  Alternatively, signal names can be specified via the 'Selections' 
  option below.  All named signals are represented in the resulting 
  signal group, with the signal data reverting to all NaNs for any 
  signals not found in a particular file. 
 
  As an alternative to operating on all files found in the 'dname folder, 
  specific filenames to be included may be listed in a file "include.txt" 
  placed either in the current working directory or the 'dname' folder.  
  That file may list either simple filenames or full pathnames. If some 
  files are to be excluded, those filenames or pathnames should be listed 
  in a file called "exclude.txt" and the file placed in the working 
  directory or 'dname' folder. The "include.txt" file, if found, is read 
  before any "exclude.txt" file.  If these files are found in both 
  locations, the current working directory takes precedence. 
 
  Additional options may be specified via option/value pairs, as follows: 
    'Selections'      -  cell array of signal names to collect. Overrides  
                         retrieval of these names from "names.txt". 
    'SourceType'      -  'sourcetype' identifier from "NameTables.xlsx", 
                         specifying units conversions and description 
                         modifications to be applied to the named signals 
                         (see function "ExtractData"). 
    'CategoryFun'     -  function handle applied to file root names to 
                         derive "category strings".  If provided, the 
                         function performs a separate concatenation operation 
                         for each detected category. As an example, the 
                         function @(x)x(1:10) can be used to extract date 
                         strings from root names that start with the pattern 
                         'yyyy-mm-dd', to perform separate collections by 
                         date. (Root names are derived from pathnames 
                         using function "GetRootname".) 
    'DownSampFactor'  -  integer-valued downsampling factor. If specified, 
                         all signals are downsampled by this factor. 
    'NanSeparators'   -  'on' or 'off' (default). If 'on', NaN values 
                         are placed at the signal endpoints before 
                         concatenation, to permit signals from individual 
                         input files to be distinguished when plotting. 
    'OutputTag'       -  optional tag string to be included as part of 
                         the output filename (see below). 
 
  The resulting signal group 'Signals' and time group 'Time', along with 
  a cell array 'fnames' listing the names and order of files read, are 
  stored as .mat file "joined_signals.mat" within the 'dname' folder, 
  unless an optional output folder 'outfolder' is specified.  If 'pathnames' 
  are specified, the 'outfolder' argument is required.  If concatenation 
  is by category, the output files are named "joined_signals_*.mat", with 
  the derived category strings appended.  The 'OutputTag' string, if 
  provided, is enclosed in parentheses and appended at the end of the 
  final filename root.

              "include.txt"
              "exclude.txt"
              "LoadResults.m"
 
  Collects a defined set of signals from VTool "results" files found 
  in folder 'dname', and concatenates them into full-length signal 
  groups.  Files are assumed to be named according to the convention 
  "results_*.mat" and their contents are assumed to include one or more 
  VTool datasets.  Alternatively, a cell array of pathnames to desired 
  input files is directly specified via a 'pathnames' argument. 
 
  The named signals are extracted from the datasets in each file, and 
  concatenated into signal groups, one per dataset variable, extending 
  the data length until the files are exhausted.  The signal groups are 
  named 'Signals_&lt;...&gt;', where the suffix corresponds to the name of the 
  dataset from which the signals are drawn. 
 
  The desired signal names are specified in file "names.txt", which 
  must be present in the 'dname' folder or the current working 
  directory, with the current working directory taking precedence. 
  Alternatively, signal names can be specified via the 'Selections' 
  option below. 
 
  As an alternative to operating on all results files found in the 
  'dname' folder, specific filenames to be included may also be listed 
  in a file "include.txt" placed either in the current working directory 
  or the 'dname' folder.  That file may list either simple filenames or 
  full pathnames. If some files are to be excluded, those filenames or 
  pathnames should be listed in a file called "exclude.txt" and the file 
  placed in the working directory or 'dname' folder. The "include.txt" 
  file, if found, is read before any "exclude.txt" file.  If these files 
  are found in both locations, the current working directory takes 
  precedence. 
 
  Time vectors corresponding to all datasets and all files read are 
  similary concatenated into signal groups 'Time_&lt;...&gt;', where the 
  suffix corresponds to the name of the dataset from which the time 
  is drawn.  If all time signal groups are equal, the 'Time_&lt;...&gt;' 
  groups are reduced to a single 'Time' group. 
 
  Any non-dataset variables found in the files are assembled into 
  arrays of the appropriate type, with length equal to the number 
  of files.  NOTE: All files must contain the same variables, or an 
  error will result. 
 
  The function "LoadResults" is used to load data from the input files. 
  The default version of this function can be found in "&lt;VTool&gt;\templates". 
  A local copy of this function can be used to provide user-definable 
  modifications to the file contents (e.g., re-sampling or other 
  size-reducing operations).  As an alternative to a local copy, a user-
  defined function handle may be directly provided via the 'LoadFun' 
  option (see below). 
 
  Additional options may be specified via option/value pairs, as follows: 
    'Selections'      -  cell array of signal names to collect. Overrides  
                         retrieval of these names from "names.txt". 
    'LoadFun'         -  function handle defining a user-selectable 
                         load function. For example, @(x)load(x,'var1') 
                         limits loading to the 'var1' variable only. 
    'CategoryFun'     -  function handle applied to file root names to 
                         derive "category strings".  If provided, the 
                         function performs a separate concatenation operation 
                         for each detected category. As an example, the 
                         function @(x)x(1:10) can be used to extract date 
                         strings from root names that start with the pattern 
                         'yyyy-mm-dd', to perform separate concatenations by 
                         date. (Root names are derived from pathnames 
                         using function "GetRootname".) 
    'DownSampFactor'  -  integer-valued downsampling factor. If specified, 
                         all signals are downsampled by this factor. 
    'NanSeparators'   -  'on' or 'off' (default). If 'on', NaN values 
                         are placed at the dataset enpoints before 
                         signal extraction and concatenation, to permit 
                         signals from individual datasets to be distinguished 
                         when plotting.

  ConvertToSarray(pathname)
  ConvertToSarray(pathnames)
  ConvertToSarray(folder,filetype)
  ConvertToSarray(...., names)
 
  Bulk file conversion function. 
 
  Converts data files to VTool S-array format.  Operates on either 
  1) the single file pointed to by 'pathname', or 2) a list of files 
  of matching file type, designated by a cell array of 'pathnames', e.g.,  
  {'pathname1','pathname2',...}, or 3) files contained with a specified 
  'folder' and matching a specified 'filetype' (see function "IsFileType"). 
 
  The conversion can be limited to a specific set of signals via an 
  optional final argument 'names', which is a cell array listing the 
  names of the desired signals.  Signals not named in this list are 
  excluded from the output file(s). 
 
  The S-array format preserves the individual signal sampling, enabling 
  clean-up/filtering operations prior to re-sampling onto a common time 
  grid via "ExtractData".  Type "help formats" and see function "IsSarray" 
  for additional information on S-array format. 
 
  Output file naming
  -------------------
  The output .mat file for each input file is named using the convention

  all group definitions, signal scaling, units conversions, and description 
  modifications consistent with the definition of 'sourcetype' within 
  "NameTables.xlsx" are applied to retrieved signals before storing to 
  the output file.  However, if 'sourcetype' is empty, all signals are

  Copy all names, name layers, and units from a model dataset or 
  signal group. The "model" is specified by 'Data0' or 'Signals0', 
  and the target object is 'Data' or 'Signals', respectively. This 
  operation can be employed to force name and units matching in 
  preparation for plotting or comparison.  It is only valid if the 
  model object has matching structure.  For signal groups, the 
  requirement is a matching number of signals (though signal lengths 
  need not match). vFor datasets, matching signal group names must 
  be present, and all groups must have matching number of signals. 
 
  Also accepts dataset arrays and signal-group arrays. The model 
  'Data0' in the case of dataset array 'DATA' may itelf be a dataset 
  array of any size.  Similarly, the model 'Signals0' in the case of 
  signal-group array 'SIGNALS' may also be a signal-group array of

  If the 'keep' option is chosen, the function adds missing 
  name layers only.  It does not overwrite or replace name

  'Pyy', and 'Perr', giving the real-valued power spectra of 
  'Signals1', 'Signals2', and the Signal2-Signal1 differences, 
  respectively. 
 
  The real-valued power spectra (Pxx,Pyy,Perr) are returned in units 
  of (.)^2/Hz. However, if 'dB' is specified as as final argument, 
  they are returned in dB instead. 
 
  The sampling frequency is determined by the first signal group.  
  Signals are re-sampled to the common 'Ts1' time grid and their 
  means removed before computing the spectra. 
 
  If one or more signals within 'Signals1' or 'Signals2' consists 
  of all NaNs, the corresponding spectra are represented as all 
  NaNs in the output. 
 
  Also works for signal-group arrays 'SIGNALS1' and 'SIGNALS2', 
  in which case 'Pxy', 'Pxx', 'Pyy', and 'Perr' are returned as 
  signal-group arrays of the matching length.

  [del,Nref] = DamageEquivLoad(x,t,slope,Nref,Life)
  [del,Nref] = DamageEquivLoad(x,T,slope,Nref,Life)
 
  Computes the damage equivalent load of time series vector 'x' 
  given S-N fatigue 'slope'.  Outputs damage equivalent load 
  value 'del' and the corresponding number of reference cycles, 
  taken to be the actual number of counted cycles in the time 
  series.  Alternatively, the user may directly specify the 
  number of reference cycles by providing a non-empty value 
  for 'Nref'. 
 
  Input 'Life' specifies a lifetime duration for extrapolating 
  the computed 'del' value.  It requires specification of time 
  vector 't' matching 'x' in length, or scalar 'T' representing 
  a sample time for 'x'.  Input 'Life' is interpreted in the units 
  provided for 't' or 'T'.

  Note that fields 'dt', 'unitsT' and 'trigger' derive from the 
  same dataset time vector, and are thus uniform for all signals.  
  The 'dt' field is a constant for uniform sampling, and a vector 
  of length(data)-1 otherwise.  The 'trigger' field is set to a 
  numerical scalar start time value for real-valued time, or to 
  an absolute start time representation if Data.Time has absolute

  signals or groups not listed are simply downsampled by the 'factor' 
  (i.e., minus any filtering) to produce data of matching length. If

  Data = DefineSignalGroup(Data,group,names)
  Data = DefineSignalGroup(Data,group,names,'nowarn')
  Data = DefineSignalGroup(Data,group)
 
  Defines a new signal group on dataset 'Data', or re-defines an 
  existing signal group, based on a list of signal names present 
  on the dataset.  Input 'group' specifies the group name to be 
  defined (or re-defined), and 'names' is the list of signal names.  
  Each entry in 'names' is a signal name drawn from any name layer 
  present in 'Data'. 
 
  If 'names' contains empty names, or names not found in the input 
  dataset, then placeholder signals are included in the new (or 
  re-defined) group at the corresponding locations.  The placeholder 
  signals are assigned all-NaN signal values, and the given names are

  EXTRACTDATA - Extract data from a file (PRIMARY USER INTERFACE FUNCTION).

  s = ExtractData(..., TS,Trange,'nowarn')
 
  Extracts data from a file of any supported format, returning 
  output 's' in a generic VTool dataset format. This is a dispatch 
  function, permitting extraction of signal data independent of 
  "source type" or data file format. 
 
  The list of valid source types can be obtained from function 
  "ListSourceTypes".  These correspond to names of "source tabs" 
  within the applicable "NameTables.xls" file.  Multiple file 
  formats are supported for each source type.  Type "help formats" 
  and see function "IsFileType" for more information on supported 
  file formats. 
  
  If a 'sourcetype' is specified, all grouping, signal scaling, 
  units conversions, and description modifications consistent with 
  the definition of 'sourcetype' within the "NameTables.xlsx" file 
  are applied to the result.  However, if no 'sourcetype' is specified 
  (or if file is in .vtl format), no modification of the contents is 
  performed. 
 
  A warning normally results if one or more signal names specified in 
  "NameTables.xlsx" is not present in the file.  The 'nowarn' option, 
  specified as a final argument, suppresses this warning. 
 
  Optional inputs 'TS' (sample time) and 'Trange' (1x2 time range 
  vector specifying [Tmin,Tmax]) provide for re-sampling of the 
  extracted data.  If either is specified as [], the corresponding 
  operation is not performed.

  [NAMES,Layers] = GetNamesMatrix(Data)
 
  Returns the 'NAMES' matrix for signal group 'Signals'. 
  Rows of the matrix correspond to signals in the group, 
  and columns correspond to name layers.  Also returns 
  the list of layers as cell array 'Layers'.  If called 
  without output arguments, the results are printed to 
  the screen as a chart. 
 
  If dataset 'Data' is provided as an input argument, 
  a concatenated 'NAMES' matrix, representing a composite 
  of all signal groups, is returned.

  If 'Data' contains a 2- or higher dimensional array, the array is 
  expanded into an equivalent set of 1-dimensional column vectors to 
  produce a new set of 1-dimensional signals.  The corresponding 'Names' 
  entry is interpreted as a root name, and appropriate subscripting with 
  trailing numerals is used to name the individual signals. The underscore 
  character '_' is employed where necessary to separate the subscripts.  
  All other attributes are replicated across the expanded set of signals.

  MAKEVTLFILE - Make a .vtl file from time-synchronized data.
  MakeVtlFile(pathname,t,Values,Names,Units,Descriptions,sourcetype)
  MakeVtlFile(pathname,t,Values,[],[],[],sourcetype)
 
  Saves a .vtl file constructed from "time synchronized" data to 
  the specified 'pathname' (and overwriting any existing file if 
  present).  Time synchronization implies that a single time vector 
  't' applies to all signals, with signals arranged as columns of 
  a 'Values' matrix. 
 
  Inputs to the function are as follows: 
     't'             -  Nx1 time vector, either real-valued or in 
                        absolute-time units ('datetime', 'datenum'), 
     'Values'        -  NxM values array, representing M signals of 
                        length N, 
     'Names'         -  (OPTIONAL) length-M cell array of signal 
                        names, defaulting to {'x1','x2',...,'xM'} 
                        if [] is specified, 
     'Units'         -  (OPTIONAL) length-M cell array of units 
                        designations, defaulting to empty strings 
                        {'','',...} if [] is specified, 
     'Descriptions'  -  (OPTIONAL) length-M cell array of signal 
                        descriptions, defaulting to empty strings 
                        {'','',...} if [] is specified, 
     'sourcetype'    -  sourcetype identification string. 
 
  Parameter 'sourcetype' is a string-valued input corresponding 
  to a "source tab" within the applicable "NameTables.xls" file.  
  All group definitions, signal scaling, units conversions, and 
  description modifications consistent with the definition of 
  'sourcetype' within "NameTables.xlsx" are applied to the data 
  before storing in the output file.  However, if 'sourcetype' 
  is given as '', no modifications are performed.

  MATCHSIGNALTOREF - Match a signal to a reference signal.

  [q,delay] = MatchSignalToRef(t,x,t0,x0,delay0)
  [q,delay] = MatchSignalToRef(t,x,t0,x0,dvec)
  [q,delay,xdelay,xdelay0] = MatchSignalToRef(...)
  MatchSignalToRef(...)
 
  Returns the correlation coefficient 'q' for the best match 
  between signal (t,x) and a delayed version of reference signal 
  (t0,x0), i.e., (t0+delay,x0).  Both the correlation coefficient 
  'q' and the corresponding optimal 'delay' are returned.  (A 
  positive value for 'delay' implies that signal 'x' lags 'x0', 
  and a negative value implies that it leads.) 
 
  By default, an unconstrained minimization is performed, with 
  optional input 'delay0' specifying an initial guess for 'delay', 
  and a zero initial guess assumed otherwise.  If vector 'dvec' 
  of candidate delay values is provided in place of 'delay', a 
  brute-force search is performed instead. 
 
  Additional outputs 'xdelay' and 'xdelay0' represent the optimally 
  delayed version of 'x', sampled on time grids 't' and 't0', 
  respectively.  For efficiency, these outputs are not computed 
  if the corresponding output arguments are not supplied. 
 
  If called without output arguments, a plot is generated 
  showing the relationship of correlation coefficient to 
  the applied delay, with the computed optimal delay value 
  notated.

  Data1 = NanFillDataset(Data,Trange)
  Data1 = NanFillDataset(Data,Ts)
  [Data1,DataC,DataX] = NanFillDataset(...)
 
  Performs time-grid regularization and nan-filling on a dataset to repair 
  irregularly placed and/or missing time samples. Determines the dominant 
  sample time, or explicit sample time 'Ts' if provided, to define a regular 
  time grid starting from the dataset's initial time value and spanning the 
  represented time range. It then removes samples deviating from the grid and 
  fills missing sample positions with NaN values. The result is dataset 'Data1' 
  with uniform time sampling. Input 'Trange' is a 1x2 vector specifying an 
  alternate time range in compatible time units, used to override the dataset's 
  original time range if desired. 
 
  Also returned are dataset 'DataC', representing a "cleaned-up" dataset after 
  removal of irregularly placed and out-of-range samples but before nan-filling, 
  and dataset 'DataX', containing only the errant samples. 
 
  The input dataset's time vector must be strictly monotonically increasing. 
  For best results, all time values should be evenly divisible by the dominant 
  or specified sample time after subtraction of the initial time offset. For 
  datasets with absolute time units, appropriate rounding is recommended: as 
  an example, time values in a vector 't' can be rounded to whole-number 
  seconds using "dateshift(t,'start','sec','nearest')", and rounding to 
  minutes, hours, or other units follows similarly.

  PlotBinnedSequences(SIGNALS,[],[],Names)
 
  Plots raw signals in a signal-group array after segregating

  signal groups of M signals each.  Input 'iclass' is a length-N 
  vector of bin index values ranging from 0 to P, with 0 indicating

  Signals within the same bin are plotted as contiguous sequences 
  distinguished by color.  The different bins are represented in 
  separate subplots.  Up to 25 bins are supported*.  Input 'BinTitles'

  PLOTSIGNALGROUP - Plot and analyze a signal group or signal group array.
  PlotSignalGroup(Signals)
  PlotSignalGroup(Time,Signals)
  PlotSignalGroup(TIMES,SIGNALS)
  PlotSignalGroup(TIMES,SIGNALS,&lt;Option1&gt;,&lt;Value&gt;,&lt;Option2&gt;,{Value&gt;,...)
 
  Plots all or a selection of signals from signal group array 'Signals' 
  or signal group array 'SIGNALS'.  Input 'Time' (or 'TIMES') is the 
  signal group (or equal-length signal-group array) containing the 
  time signals for the array elements.  A scalar signal-group structure 
  'Time' may be provided if the time signal is common to all array 
  elements.  If omitted entirely, signals are plotted versus a unitless 
  time index. 
 
  Like-named signals across the array are plotted as curve families within 
  subplots, in a succession of stacked figure windows, and annotations for 
  the plots are drawn from the signal-group attributes. 
 
  A subset of the contained signals, and control over the format of the 
  plots, may be specified via option/value pairs, the options including: 
    'names'         -  a list of selected signal names, defaulting to 
                       all signals in group if empty or not specified. 
                       The elements of 'names' may be drawn from any 
                       combination of available name layers. 
    'groupname'     -  a category name for the group or array, used 
                       for messaging to the screen only, and defaulting 
                       to 'group' if empty or not specified. 
    'titlestr'      -  a title string to include on all plot windows, 
                       defaulting to the empty string if not specified. 
    'Legend'        -  a cell array of legend strings, the array equal 
                       in length to 'Signals', defaulting to none if 
                       'Signals' is scalar, and {'Group 1','Group 2', ...} 
                       if a group array. 
    'nrows'         -  number of subplot rows per figure window, default-
                       ing to the value defined in function "GetParam". 
                       Ignored if 'OptionSingle' is set to 'on'. 
    'OptionSingle'  -  'off' or 'on', with 'on' enforcing full-window 
                       plots, but defaulting to 'off' if not specified. 
    'OptionTime'     - 'off' or 'on', with 'on' specifying a time-series 
                       plot for each signal (default 'on'). 
    'OptionPSD'     -  'off' or 'on', with 'on' specifying inclusion of 
                       a power spectral density plot for each signal 
                       (default 'off'). 
    'OptionPSDE'    -  'off' or 'on', with 'on' specifying inclusion of 
                       of a power spectral density error plot for each 
                       signal, computed with respect to the corresponding 
                       signal in the first signal group array element 
                       (default 'off').  Choosing this option also turns 
                       on 'OptionPSD', and both sets of power spectra are 
                       plotted on the same axes. 
    'OptionCOH'     -  'off' or 'on', with 'on' specifying inclusion of 
                       spectral coherence magnitude and phase plots, 
                       computed with respect to corresponding signals in 
                       the first signal-group array element (default 'off'). 
    'OptionLabels'  -  'off' or 'on', with 'on' specifying annotation of 
                       the complete set of signal name labels from all 
                       name layers within the plot axes (default 'on'). 
    'tag'           -  a string tag to record on all generated figures, 
                       defaulting to current date-time string if not 
                       specified. 
 
  If 'Signals' is a group array, all but the 'Values' field are assumed 
  identical across the array, including information on all name layers. 
  The length of the array determines the number of lines in each plot. 
  Time and frequency axes across all plots and generated figures are 
  separately linked, to enable synchronized zooming and panning. (Turn 
  this feature off after plotting using function "UnlinkAxes".)

  PlotSignalsInCombination(Data,names, ...)
  PlotSignalsInCombination(Signals,names, ...)
 
  Plots a mixed set of named signals as a grouping within subplots, 
  each subplot containing the given signal set drawn from successive 
  elements of a dataset or signal group array. The first input 
  ('DATA' or 'SIGNALS') specifies the input array, and the second 
  input ('names') specifies the list of signals to appear within 
  each subplot. Additional figures are opened as needed to accommodate 
  the full number of array elements. (Note that a length-1 array, 
  i.e., a scalar dataset 'Data' or scalar signal group 'Signals', 
  is also permissible.) 
 
  The signals within successive subplots are annotated using either 
  "source" strings from the dataset array, if present, or a generated 
  numerical sequence (e.g., '001','002', ...). If the input array 
  is multidimensional, the indexing into the array is ordered in 
  columnwise fashion. 
 
  Additional control over the plotting, including number of rows 
  per figure window, specification of power spectral density or 
  coherence plots, etc., can be realized by providing any of the 
  option/value pairs defined in function "PlotSignalGroup". Note 
  that if a 'Legend' option is specified, the specified legend 
  strings will be understood to apply to the elements of the 
  'names' list.

  Plots selected signals from a dataset with user-definable grouping 
  of signals within subplots.  Input 'Data' is a scalar dataset, and 
  'Names' is a 1d or 2d cell array of signal names.  If 'Names' is a 
  row array, a single plot is produced with the corresponding signals 
  plotted on a single set of axes.  If 'Names' has additional rows, 
  the number of rows defines a desired number of subplots, and each 
  row specifies the contents of the corresponding subplot.
 
  Additional control over the plotting, including number of rows

  that if a 'Legend' option is specified, the specified legend strings 
  will be understood to apply to the columns of the 'Names' array. 
 
  Null signal names ('') are permitted in the 'Names' array, and 
  result in the corresponding signal being omitted from the plot. 
 
  If dataset array 'DATA' is provided in place of scalar dataset 
  'Data', the plotting is repeated for all elements of the array. 
  If scalar signal group 'Signals', or signal group array 'SIGNALS' 
  is provided, these are paired with a unitless indexed time group 
  to form an implied dataset or dataset array, respectively, and 
  the function proceeds accordingly.

  Plots "short-time" (e.g., pointwise) stats from a "Stats array" and 
  the companion 'Info' structure generated using "ComputeStatsArray".  
  Alternatively, loads these structures from the "computed_stats" 
  file specified by 'pathname'. 
 
  The function behavior can be modified by supplying option/value 
  pairs.  The following options are available: 
    'PlotMode'    -  'normal' (default) or 'single'.  In the 'normal' 
                     mode, plots are arranged in a 3 X 2 format per 
                     figure window (rows corresponding to signals, 
                     and columns corresponding to "StStats" and 
                     "StErr" statistics).  The 'single' mode 
                     specifies only one plot per figure window. 
    'StatNames'   -  cell array of names, of length matching that 
                     of 'Stats', to be used for the plot legends. 
                     If not provided, the function defaults to the 
                     Stats(i).name strings. 
    'Selections'  -  cell array of signal names to plot. The 
                     default is all signals in the Stats array. 
    'CasesPerBin' -  option to annotate the plots to show the

  Reads the "MASTER" tab of "NameTables.xlsx" and returns two output 
  structures, 'Names' and 'SourceType', plus cell arrays 'Layers' and 
  'ALLNAMES'.  Fields of 'Names' correspond to groups listed in the 
  spreadsheet, which are themselves structures.  Fields of these 
  group structures correspond to columns of the spreadsheet (a.k.a. 
  "name layers"), and the contents of these fields are matching sets 
  of ordered name lists for the group.  The list of name layers is 
  returned as cell array 'Layers', and the complete matrix of names, 
  having the name layers as columns, is returned as cell array 
  'ALLNAMES'. 
 
  The fields of 'SourceType' are layer names that correspond to columns 
  of the MASTER tab spreadsheet (e.g., 'Layer1Names', 'Layer2Names' ...). 
  The 'Names' ending is appended if not already present.  The value 
  assigned to each field indicates the "source type for each layer, 
  which is information contained on the second row of the MASTER tab 
  spreadsheet.  Sources are uniquely tied to name layers (via functions 
  "Source2Layer" and "Layer2Source"), but may share "source types" with 
  other name layers (e.g., compare rows 1 and 2 of MASTER tab in 
  "NameTables (sample).xlsx"). 
 
  Source types are associated with additional tabs in he "NameTables.xls"

  identified by signal names having a common base name and ending 
  in numerals.  Examples are {'deflection1', 'deflection2', ...}, 
  or {'pos11', 'pos12', 'pos21', 'pos22').  The numerals need 
  not be contiguous.  Output dataset 'Data1' is returned with 
  1-dimensional signals grouped into signal group 'Scalars', and 
  multi-dimentional signals grouped according to base name. 
 
  Optional input 'layer' specifies the name layer to use when 
  classifying signals.  If 'layer' is specified as [] or not 
  provided, the default signal names are used (see function 
  "GetDefaultNames").  The signals and groups are assembled 
  alphabetically by default; however, if the 'stable' option is 
  specified , they are assembled in the order encountered in the 
  original dataset.

  Returns signal group 'Signals1' obtained by removing signals specified

  list of one or more signal names, each entry drawn from any name layer 
  contained in 'Signals'.  However, the empty string name ('') is

  Data = ResampleDataset(...,method,extrapval)
 
  Resamples all signal groups in 'Data' on a new time grid.  
  Input 'Trange' is an optional 1x2 vector specifying a desired 
  time range.  Values for 'Trange' are interpreted in the time 
  units of the supplied dataset (e.g., elapsed time, absolute 
  time in date numbers, or, if the Matlab version supports it, 
  absolute time in 'datetime' values).  However, if values in 
  'Trange' are  real-valued and small (i.e., &lt; 1e5), they are 
  always interpreted as elapsed seconds from start of the dataset.  
  If 'Trange' is empty, an "empty" version of the dataset is 
  returned, i.e., one with data length equal to 0. 
 
  Input 'TS' specifies an optional re-sampling time, implicitly 
  in sec, or explicity if given in 'duration' type.  If empty or 
  omitted, then no re-sampling is performed. 
 
  If Data.Time is in elapsed time units (i.e., not 'datenum' or 
  'datetime' type), the returned time vector is always adjusted 
  to start again from zero.  To limit the time range of a dataset 
  without re-zeroing, see function "LimitTimeRange", or provide 
  time vector 't' as explained next. 
 
  An alternative to specifying 'TS' and 'Trange' is to provide 
  time vector 't'.  As with 'Trange', time values in 't' are 
  interpreted in the units employed for Data.Time or in elapsed 
  seconds from the start time.  The dataset is resampled directly 
  onto 't' or its converted equivalent.  Data.Time.Values is set 
  to the new time vector, and no further manipulation of the time 
  vector is performed. 
 
  The default interpolation method is 'linear', with no 
  extrapolation beyond the limits of the original time axis. 
  Optional inputs 'method' and 'extrapval' permit specification 
  of alternative method ('spline','nearest','previous',etc.) and 
  extrapolation behavior (e.g., 'extrap' or fixed value), per 
  the Matlab "interp1" function.

  RunBatchFunction(fun,dname,filetype)
  RunBatchFunction(..., 'parfor')
 
  Files used: "include.txt"
              "exclude.txt"
 
  Runs the batch function specified by function handle 'fun' on either 
  searched or directly specified input files, depending on the calling 
  syntax employed, with option to use a parallel worker pool. 
 
  The batch function is any function of a single pathname variable, 
  but may accept additional arguments via Matlab's "anonymous function" 
  construct.  The function is assumed to store any required results to 
  a .mat file, with the naming convention "results_*.mat" recommended. 
 
  In the simplest form, if one or more 'pathnames' to files(s) are 
  provided, the function is run on all named files.  If directory 
  'dname' and file type specification 'filetype' are provided, the 
  function is run on all files in 'dname' matching the specified type. 
  For a description of file formats and defining characteristics,  
  type "help formats" and see function "IsFileType". 
 
  As an alternative to operation on all files found, specific filenames 
  to be included may be listed in a file "include.txt" placed either 
  in the current working directory or the 'dname' folder.  That file 
  may list either simple filenames or full pathnames.  Similarly, if 
  some files are to be excluded, those filenames or pathnames should 
  be listed in a file called "exclude.txt" and the file placed in the 
  working directory or 'dname' folder.  The "include.txt" file, if 
  found, is read before any "exclude.txt" file.  If these files are 
  found in both locations, the current working directory takes 
  precedence. 
 
  The restriction that input files be resident under a single 'dname' 
  folder can be overcome by direct specification of pathnames via input 
  cell array 'pathnames'. This overrides both the filename search and 
  the filtering for inclusions/exclusions. (See function "FindFilesOfType" 
  and related functions for additional search options.)
 
  If the keyword 'parfor' is provided as a final argument, the Matlab 
  "parfor" command is invoked, and the job is executed employing worker 
  processes in a parallel pool. 
 
  If any cases fail to run successfully, the names are listed in a 
  file "failed.txt" and saved to the current working directory.

  SELECTFROMGROUP - Reduce a signal group to a set of selected signals.
  Signals1 = SelectFromGroup(names,Signals)
  Signals1 = SelectFromGroup(ivec,Signals)
  [Signals1,ismatched,index] = SelectFromGroup(names,Signals)
  [Signals1,ismatched,index] = SelectFromGroup(ivec,Signals)
 
  Returns signal group 'Signals1' obtained by selecting the subset of 
  signals specified by 'names' from the larger signal group 'Signals'. 
  Input 'names' is a list of zero or more signal names, each entry drawn 
  from any name layer contained in 'Signals'.  However, the empty string 
  name ('') is considered a match only if it appears on all name layers. 
  In the event of a duplicated name, only the first instance is considered. 
  As an alternative to specifying 'names', an integer index list 'ivec' 
  may be supplied instead. 
 
  A warning message is written to the screen if any element of the 
  'names' (or 'ivec') list is not found in the 'Signals' signal group.  
  Optionally, a second output argument 'ismatched' can be supplied to 
  suppress the warning and return a binary mask to indicate which names 
  are matched.  A third output 'index' gives the index values of the 
  matched signals, or 0 where there is no match.

  SEQUENCEDATASETS - Sequence datasets contiguously in time.
  DATA = SequenceDatasets(Data1,Data2,Data3, ...)
  DATA = SequenceDatasets(DATA1,DATA2,DATA3, ...)
 
  Accepts one or more datasets (Data1,Data2,Data3,...) or dataset 
  array inputs ('DATA1','DATA2','DATA3',...) and produces a single 
  dataset array 'DATA' representing the input datasets contiguously 
  ordered in elapsed time.  All inputs must have the same fields.  
  Inputs may have time in any real-valued units ('sec', 'min', etc., 
  or unitless), provided all units are the same.  One or more of the 
  inputs may also be in absolute time units (e.g., 'datetime') 
  convertible to elapsed 'sec'.  Time in the output dataset array is 
  expressed in the elapsed-time units of the inputs, or in elapsed 
  'sec' by default.

  SEQUENCETIME - Generate a sequenced time array.
  TIMES = SequenceTime(Time,offset,N)
  TIMES = SequenceTime(Time,'join',N)
  TIMES = SequenceTime(Time,'catenate',N)
 
  Extends time group 'Time' into a time array of length 'N', 
  with the scalar parameter 'offset' specifying the spacing 
  between the start times of successive elements.  If keyword 
  'join' is specified in place of 'offset', the start time 
  of the kth element is set to the end time of the (k-1)th 
  element.  If 'catenate' is specified, successive elements 
  are spaced with one sample time of separation*. 
 
  Signal group 'Time' may be of any type.  If 'Time' is in 
  'datetime' type, parameter 'offset' may be specified either 
  in 'duration' type or in real-valued seconds. 
 
  *Sample time is determined from "GetSampleTime" using the 
  'simple' method option.

  SOURCE2LAYER - Name layer corresponding to a source string.

  SPECTSIGNALS - Compute power spectral density for a signal group.
  [Pxx,f] = SpectSignals(Signals,Ts)
  [Pxx,f] = SpectSignals(SIGNALS,Ts)
  [Pxx,f] = SpectSignals(..., 'dB')
 
  Computes the power spectral density of signals in a signal 
  group.  Input 'Signals' is a signal group containing M signal 
  channels of time series data, and output 'Pxx' is a signal 
  group containing the corresponding M spectra.  Input 'Ts' 
  specifies the sample time in sec.  Output 'f' is the frequency 
  vector in 'Hz'. 
 
  Output spectra are returned in units of (.)^2/Hz. However, 
  if 'dB' is specified as as final argument, they are returned 
  in dB instead. 
 
  If one or more signals within 'Signals1' or 'Signals2' consists 
  of all NaNs, the corresponding spectra are represented as all 
  NaNs in the output. 
 
  Also works if input is a signal-group array 'SIGNALS', in which 
  case 'Pxx' is returned as a signal-group array of matching length.

  UNLINKAXES - Un-link axes after plotting.
  UnlinkAxes
  UnlinkAxes('time')
  UnlinkAxes('freq')
 
  Un-links axes generated by "PlotSignalGroup", "PlotDataset",

  the "Timeseries" plots while keeping "Spectrum" plots linked, 
  or 'freq' to perform the vice-versa option.

  WEIGHTEDHISTOGRAM - Weighted histogram calculation.
  [H,centers,means] = WeightedHistogram(values,weights,edges)
  [H,centers,means] = WeightedHistogram(values,weights,nbins)
 
  Computes histogram of data vector 'values' given equal-size 
  vector of associated 'weights'.  Input vector 'edges' defines 
  monotonically increasing bin boundaries, where edge(i) specifies 
  the left edge, and edge(i+1) the right edge of the ith bin (with 
  '-inf' and 'inf' values at the ends permitted).  Alternatively, 
  scalar parameter 'nbins' specifies the number of equal-width bins 
  between the minimum and maximum value of the 'values' vector.  
  Output 'H' is the computed histogram, 'centers' gives the derived 
  bin center values, and 'means' gives the mean of the 'values' 
  vector segregated by bin. (In the event that edges is bounded 
  by 'inf' values at either end, the center value is replaced by 
  the corresponding mean value.)  All outputs are column vectors 
  of length equal to the number of bins.

  WriteDataToCSV(outfile,Data,layer)
 
  Writes all signals in dataset 'Data' to the CSV file specified

  and signals with empty names are ignored.  If a file with the 
  specified name already exists, it is overwritten.  Conversion to

  VTool file formats.
  
  The following file formats are supported: 
 
  - VTool format (.vtl)
    Native format for VTool. See function "MakeVtlFile". This format 
    loads very fast is is space efficient. 
 
  - S-array format (S_*.mat)
    Format supporting signals with differing sample rates.  See function 
    "MakeSarrayFile" for an example source.  Contains single structure 
    array 'S', with these fields: 'name' field containing signal names, 
    'data' containing signal data vectors, 'dt' specifying sample times, 
    'unitsT' giving time units, 'units' giving signal units, 'description' 
    providing signal descriptions, and 'trigger', which is set to [] or to 
    a value specifying a non-zero start time.  (In the latter case, 'trigger' 
    can be provided as a numerical scalar, or in any absolute-time format 
    recognized by Matlab function "datenum". Only S(1).trigger is read.)  
    Because original data and individual sampling rates are preserved, this 
    format enables clean-up/filtering operations prior to re-sampling onto 
    a common time grid. 
 
  - Spreadsheet (*.xlsx, *.xls, *.csv)
    Data in "named columns" from an Excel spreadsheet or .csv file.  
    All entries in the "header row" must be valid variable names.  The 
    first column must be named 'Time' and contain Excel date numbers or 
    date-time strings.  Remaining columns must be of matching length.
